## x,y plotter, how does it work?

The xy plotter is a mechanical device that allows you to draw lines and shapes on a piece of paper. The plotter is made up of two parts: the x-axis and the y-axis. The x-axis is a horizontal line that runs across the paper, and the y-axis is a vertical line that runs up and down the paper. To use the plotter, you first need to find the point where the x-axis and the y-axis intersect. This point is called the origin. The plotter will then move the pen to this point. Next, you need to choose the direction in which you want to draw your line. To do this, you need to specify the x and y coordinates of the end point of the line. The plotter will then draw the line from the origin to the end point.
